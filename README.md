# Wiki
This is the wiki for the 3D Printers Discord. 

## Contribution
Contribution is currently restricted to specific members of the Discord server only due to the manual nature of adding collaborators. Once the wiki is established it is intended that any regular member of the Discord server will be able to contribute.

Please note that bots only update their internal version of this wiki once every 6 hours and so changes here may take some time to trickle down to the server. 

## Page Style
To make sure the wiki is as accessible as possible (by both humans and bots!) please ensure that pages follow a standard formatting. 

[GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Capitalisation
Correct and consistent capitalisation is important. Page titles should be capitalised but full caps should not be used.

Acceptable:
> Extruders

Not Acceptable:
> EXTRUDERS, extruders

### Bold Text
Bold text can be created by using a double asterix "\*\*" on either side of the text you wish to make bold. Bold text should be used to **emphasise** specific words and phrases and **not** used on entire paragraphs.

Example:
> Make sure to **enable** thermal runaway protection.

Created by:
> Make sure to \*\*enable\*\* thermal runaway protection. 

### Intro 
The first line of any page should be an introduction paragraph that describes the content on the page. Note that this will be used by the server bot as a descriptive text in bot commands. This should **not** be prefixed with a header such as "Introduction" and must begin on line 1. 

### Additional Detail Entries
When further detail is required for a topic please use the following format:

`For additional details see: 
[Page Title](url)`
### Tables of Contents
When creating a table of contents use the following format:

*****
 ****Table of Contents****

[Materials](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials) 
* [Filaments](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#filaments)  
  * [FFF/FDM](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#ffffdm)
    * [Filament Colours](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#filament-colours)
* [SLS](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#sls) 
* [Other Exotic Materials](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#other-exotic-materials)
* [Safety](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#safety) 
  * [Filament Safety](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#filament-safety) 
* [Filament Care](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials#filament-care) 
*****

> ***** should be used on the lines before and after the table to display it as a separate section.

> The top line of the table should contain a link to the page itself.

> Each header should be added to the table and indented using bullet points (either * or - ) according to the heading type.

> The [materials](https://github.com/3DprinterDiscord/wiki/wiki/Materials) page contents table can be used as an example to refer to.


### Things to Avoid
There are a couple of things which can make the wiki look confusing:

#### Additional Titles
Github will automatically title pages for you so there is no need to include a top level title at the top of the page. This will end up creating a double title and will confuse the bot! 

#### Not Previewing Pages
Github lets you preview you pages before you comit them to the wiki. Please use this feature to ensure the formatting looks as intended. 

#### Ignoring this style guide
If you have read this far I'm assuming that you will work within the guidance of this style guide! Please help maintain the wiki by flagging pages that are not correct within the issue tracker.
