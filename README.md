# Wiki
This is the wiki for the 3D Printers Discord. 

## Contribution
Currently contribution is currently restricted to specific members of the Discord server only due to the manual nature of adding collaborators. Once the wiki is established it is intended that any regular member of the Discord server will be able to contribute.

## Page Style
To enable the wiki to be as accessible as possible (by both humans and bots!) please ensure that pages follow a standard formatting. 

### Intro 
The first line of any page should be an introduction paragraph that describes the content on the page. Note that this will be used by the server bot as a descriptive text in bot commands. This should **not** be prefixed with a header such as "Introduction" and must begin on line 1.
