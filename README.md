# Wiki
This is the wiki for the 3D Printers Discord. 

## Contribution
Currently contribution is currently restricted to specific members of the Discord server only due to the manual nature of adding collaborators. Once the wiki is established it is intended that any regular member of the Discord server will be able to contribute.

Please note that bots only update their internal version of this wiki once every 6 hours and so changes here may take some time to trickle down to the server. 

## Page Style
To enable the wiki to be as accessible as possible (by both humans and bots!) please ensure that pages follow a standard formatting. 

### Bold Text
Bold text can be created by using a double asterix "\*\*" on either side of the text you wish to make bold. Bold text should be used to **emphasise** specific words and phrases and **not** used on entire paragraphs.

Exmaple:
> Make sure to **enable** thermal runaway protection.

Created by:
> Make sure to \*\*enable\*\* thermal runaway protection. 

### Intro 
The first line of any page should be an introduction paragraph that describes the content on the page. Note that this will be used by the server bot as a descriptive text in bot commands. This should **not** be prefixed with a header such as "Introduction" and must begin on line 1.
